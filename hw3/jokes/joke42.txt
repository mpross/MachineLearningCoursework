Two men are discussing the age old question: who enjoys sex more, the man
or the woman? A woman walks by and listens in for awhile and then
interrupts:

"Listen you guys. You know when your ear itches and you put in your
little finger and wiggle it around for awhile? Afterward, which feels
better, your finger or your ear?"
