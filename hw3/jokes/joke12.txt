A guy stood over his tee shot for what seemed an eternity, looking up,
looking down, measuring the distance, figuring the wind direction and
speed. Driving his partner nuts.

Finally his exasperated partner says, "What the hell is taking so long?
Hit the goddamn ball!" The guy answers, "My wife is up there watching me
from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot." "Well, hell,
man, you don't stand a snowball's chance in hell of hitting her from
here!"
