This couple had an excellent relationship going until one day he came
home from work to find his girlfriend packing. He asked her why she was
leaving him and she told him that she had heard awful things about him.

"What could they possibly have said to make you move out?"

"They told me that you were a pedophile."

He replied, "That's an awfully big word for a ten year old."
