A Czechoslovakian man felt his eyesight was growing steadily worse, and
felt it was time to go see an optometrist.

The doctor started with some simple testing, and showed him a standard
eye chart with letters of diminishing size: CRKBNWXSKZY. . .

"Can you read this?" the doctor asked.

"Read it?" the Czech answered. "Doc, I know him!"
