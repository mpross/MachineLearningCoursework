An Asian man goes into a New York CityBank to exchange 10,000 yen for
American Currency. The teller gives him $72.00. The next month the Asian
man goes into the same bank with 10,000 yen and receives $62.00. He asks,
"How come? Only $62.00?" The teller says "Fluctuations- Fluctuations!"

Whereupon the Asian man looks back at the teller and says "Fluk you
Amelicans too!"
