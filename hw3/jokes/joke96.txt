Two attorneys went into a diner and ordered two drinks. Then they
produced sandwiches from their briefcases and started to eat. The owner
became quite concerned and marched over and told them, "You can't eat
your own sandwiches in here!"

The attorneys looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and then
exchanged sandwiches.
