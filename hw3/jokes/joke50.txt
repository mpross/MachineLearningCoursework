A guy goes into confession and says to the priest, "Father, I'm 80 years
old, widower, with 11 grandchildren. Last night I met two beautiful
flight attendants. They took me home and I made love to both of them.
Twice."

The priest said: "Well, my son, when was the last time you were in
confession?"

"Never Father, I'm Jewish."

"So then, why are you telling me?"

"I'm telling everybody."
