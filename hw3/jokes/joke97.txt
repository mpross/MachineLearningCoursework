A teacher is explaining to her class how different languages use
negatives differently. She says, "In all languages, a positive followed
by a negative or a negative followed by a positive makes a negative. In
some languages, two negatives together make a positive, while in others
they make a negative. But in no language do two positives make a
negative."

One of the students puts up his hand and says, "Yeah, right."
