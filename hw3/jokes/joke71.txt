At a recent Sacramento PC Users Group meeting, a company was
demonstrating its latest speech- recognition software. A representative
from the company was just about ready to start the demonstration and
asked everyone in the room to quiet down.

Just then someone in the back of the room yelled, "Format C: Return."

Someone else chimed in: "Yes, Return"

Unfortunately, the software worked.
