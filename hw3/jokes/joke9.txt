A country guy goes into a city bar that has a dress code, and the maitre
d' demands he wear a tie. Discouraged, the guy goes to his car to sulk
when inspiration strikes: He's got jumper cables in the trunk! So he
wraps them around his neck, sort of like a string tie (a bulky string tie
to be sure) and returns to the bar. The maitre d' is reluctant, but says
to the guy, "Okay, you're a pretty resourceful fellow, you can come in...
but just don't start anything"!
