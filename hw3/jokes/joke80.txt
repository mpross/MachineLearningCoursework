Hillary, Bill Clinton and the Pope are sitting together on an airplane.
Bill says "I could throw one thousand dollar bill out of this plane and
make one person very happy." Hillary says "I could throw 10 hundred
dollar bills out of the plane and make 10 people very happy."

The Pope chips in and says "I could throw Bill out of the airplane and
make the whole country happy."
