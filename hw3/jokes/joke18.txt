A dog walks into Western Union and asks the clerk to send a telegram. He
fills out a form on which he writes down the telegram he wishes to send:
"Bow wow wow, Bow wow wow."

The clerk says, "You can add another 'Bow wow' for the same price."

The dog responded, "Now wouldn't that sound a little silly?"
