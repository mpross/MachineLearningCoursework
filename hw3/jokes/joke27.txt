Clinton returns from a vacation in Arkansas and walks down the steps of
Air Force One with two pigs under his arms. At the bottom of the steps,
he says to the honor guardsman, "These are genuine Arkansas Razor-Back
Hogs. I got this one for Chelsea and this one for Hillary."

The guardsman replies, "Nice trade, Sir."
