What a woman says:
"This place is a mess! C'mon,
You and I need to clean up,
Your stuff is lying on the floor and
you'll have no clothes to wear,
if we don't do laundry right now!"

What a man hears:
blah, blah, blah, blah, C'mon
blah, blah, blah, blah, you and I
blah, blah, blah, blah, on the floor
blah, blah, blah, blah, no clothes
blah, blah, blah, blah, RIGHT NOW!
